# Contributing

## What should you know before contributing?

This is a hobby project built by a self-taught programmer. There's probably a lot of times where you're going to think "This is so bad." You're probably right, and that's okay. See the section below about submitting [improvements](#improvements) below.

## Found a bug?

1. **Check to see if the bug has already been reported under [Issues](https://github.com/Last-Mile-Games/DialogueSystem/issues).** If you don't see it, feel free to open a new issue.
2. **Don't be a jerk about it.** Really, that's what the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Last-Mile-Games/DialogueSystem/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) sums up. Even if you have a valid point, make it respectfully.
3. **Be a teacher.** I'm self-taught, and it more than likely shows. Take bug reports as an oppotunity to teach best practices.

## Improvements

Have a new feature? First, check [Issues](https://github.com/Last-Mile-Games/DialogueSystem/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/Last-Mile-Games/DialogueSystem/projects) to see if it's already been brought up or accepted. If not, create an issue explaining what it is and why it would be a benefit.

Have a better way of accomplishing something? Again, check [Issues](https://github.com/Last-Mile-Games/DialogueSystem/issues) to see if it has already been brought up. If not, create one!
